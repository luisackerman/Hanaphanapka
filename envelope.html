    <p>Hello love! Happy Valentine's Day! mwahhh!!! mwahhh!!!</p>
    <p>It's only pink because it's an available flower color, I don't know if you'll like it hahahaha. But anyway, here's a flower I can give you because I don't have a bouquet yet, but I hope you like it. It's nice, so I bought it from a student who sells at school, to help with his finances.</p>
    <p> This flower is everlasting, it will not rot, it is also a beautiful display on your desk as long as it is hahahahaha. Happy Valentines again Love! mwahhh Let's go for a walk when you're free you can go home at any time Thank You Care Alwayss Love You â™¡<a href="flower.html" class="link-button">Click Me!</a> </p>
